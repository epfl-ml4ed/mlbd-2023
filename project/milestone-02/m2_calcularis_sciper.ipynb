    "# M2 | Exploration Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will do a first exploration of the data set that you will use for your project. One part of this exploration is guided, i.e. we will ask you to solve specific questions (task 1-3). The other part is open, i.e. we will ask you to come up with your own exploration ideas (task 4). \n",
    "\n",
    "Please upload your solved notebook to Moodle (under Milestone 2 Submission) adding your SCIPER number in title, example: m2-calcularis-456392.ipynb\n",

    "## Brief overview of Calcularis\n",
    "[Calcularis](https://school.alemira.com/de/calcularis/) by Alemira School is a mathematics learning program developed with neuroscientists and computer scientists from ETH Zurich. It promotes the development and interaction of the different areas of the brain that are responsible for processing numbers and quantities and solving mathematical tasks. Calcularis can be used from 1st grade to high school. Children with dyscalculia also benefit in the long term and overcome their arithmetic weakness.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For the guided part of the exploration we will focus on the three main tables:\n",
    "* ***users***: meta information about users (i.e. total time spent learning with Calcularis, geographic location).\n",
    "* ***events***: events done by the users in the platform (i.e. playing a game, selecting a new animal in the zoo simulation).\n",
    "* ***subtasks***: sub-tasks with answer attempts solved by users, primarily in the context of game events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Users\n",
    "* **user_id**: unique identifier of user in database.\n",
    "* **learning_time_ms**: total learning time in milliseconds per user, totaled over all events. This is calculated by subtracting non-learning time (i.e. if the user is idle for more than one minute).\n",
    "* **start**: timestamp of initial login.\n",
    "* **end**: timestamp of last log-off.\n",
    "* **logged_in_time_ms**: total time between login and log-off, in milliseconds. This will always be larger than learning_time_ms.\n",
    "* **language**: code for language the user is using Calcularis in (i.e. *fr* for French, *de* for german).\n",
    "* **country**: code for the country the user is using Calcularis from (i.e. *CH* for Switzerland).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Events\n",
    "* **event_id**: unique identifier of event in database.\n",
    "* **user_id**: user who peformed the event.\n",
    "* **type**: type of event (task, help, game_start_pause, training_selector, shop, attention_booster, attention_booster_over).\n",
    "* **mode**: only valid for events of type 'task', representing type of game play (normal, end_of_nr: end of number range, free_training, repetition, favorite, practice).\n",
    "* **game_name**: name of the game the user is playing. Calcularis has 29 games.\n",
    "* **learning_time_ms**: total learning time over a single game (event). To see aggregated learning time, examine learning_time_ms in the users table.\n",
    "* **number_range**: the number range of the exercise (0-10, 0-20, ... 0-1000). The larger the number range, the more difficult the exercise variation.\n",
    "* **start**: start timestamp of the event.\n",
    "* **end**: end timestamp of the event.\n",
    "* **skill_id**: skill number that this game (event) corresponds to.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Subtasks\n",
    "*There are many columns in subtasks corresponding to fields present for specific games in Calcularis. More details about corresponding fields for subtasks can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C7bKfHDdKnDzr9-EqWniYoR35ro2QuBd/view?usp=sharing). The fields discussed below are present for the majority of subtasks.*\n",
    "\n",
    "* **subtask_id**: unique identifier of the subtask in the database.\n",
    "* **event_id**: unique identifier of event in database.\n",
    "* **user_id**: user who peformed the event.\n",
    "* **answer**: the user's answer to the subtask.\n",
    "* **correct**: `True` if user obtained the correct value in their answer attempt.\n",
    "* **correctAnswerObject**: the correct answer to the question.\n",
    "* **hasProperResult**: `True` if this is a question that can be answered by a student. `False` if it corresponds to the SecretNumber game tasks, which consists of counting attempts.\n",
    "* **range**: number_range for the task (i.e. 0-20 described as R20).\n",
    "* **subtask_finished_timestamp**: ending timestamp for this subtask (within a specific event).\n",
    "* **type**: type of subtask event like ConciseEquationTaskDescription, ConciseOrderingTaskDescription (mostly corresponding to individual games, as detailed in the *Subtask Representations* document below).\n",
